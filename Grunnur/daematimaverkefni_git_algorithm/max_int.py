# Algorithm for finding the largest number from different numbers
# 1. Compare the first number to the second one. the larger number is now the largest number
# 2. If there is another number to comparek, take the largest number and compare it to the next number, the larger number is now the largest number.
# 3. Repeat step 2 until there are no more numbers left to compare
# 4. Your largest number will be the larger number of the last comparison
